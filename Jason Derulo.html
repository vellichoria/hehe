   <p  style="font-family:courier;" style="text-align:center;" style="font-size: 200%;"> i don't think i am obsessed wit him. it's just that he keeps repeating his name in his songs and his name sounds catchy. and he is easy on the eyes. 
     while googling his pictures to create a link to one of his songs, i found out he's been accused for sexual harrasment. 
        so here's the best girl group ever TT, i can say i'm obsessed. if you're interested in what kinda music new jeans makes, click on their pretty faces
